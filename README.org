#+TITLE: Emacs configuration.

* Introduction
It's just my Emacs configuration abstracted as an usable distribution.

Emacs 25+ are supported.

All packages are listed in *selected-packages.el*. Use
`package-install-selected-packages' to install them all at once. **Note**: Due
to the fact that I dumped _dash_ as part of Emacs build, others need to install
it manually.

* To-do
+ Add better Ecb faces.
+ Better langtool support.
+ Add some useful macros.
+ Add better windows management.
