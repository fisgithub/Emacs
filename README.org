#+TITLE: Emacs configuration.

* Introduction
It's just my Emacs configuration. Due the line:
#+BEGIN_BLOCK emacs-lisp
(global-display-line-numbers-mode t)
#+END_BLOCK
It only works with the master branch of Emacs. If you intend to use it with normal release, remove that line in *init.el* and use /global-linum-mode/ instead. Theme are dumped during compilation.

Needed packages are listed in *selected-packages.el*. Use `package-install-selected-packages' to install them all at once.

* To-do
+ Add better helm setup.
+ Add better Ecb faces.
+ Add langtool configuration.
+ Add some useful macros.
+ Add better windows management.
