#+TITLE: Emacs configuration.

* Introduction
It's just my Emacs configuration. Everything is tested with both Emacs 25.2 and the latest master branch. If you intend to use it, you will have to install those packages by yourself. Packages are listed in the *init.el* /package-selected-packages/ like everybody does. Use `package-install-selected-packages'.

* To-do
+ Add packages auto installation.
+ Add better helm setup.
+ Add better Ecb faces.
+ Add langtool configuration.
+ Add some useful macros.
+ Add better windows management.
