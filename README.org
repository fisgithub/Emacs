#+TITLE: Emacs configuration.

* Introduction
It's just my Emacs configuration.
Due to the line:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(global-display-line-numbers-mode t)
#+END_SRC
It only works with the /master/ branch and /emacs-26/ branch of Emacs. If you intend to use it with regular release, remove that line in *init.el* and use /global-linum-mode/ instead.

Theme are dumped during compilation phase. Search /dumping emacs/.

All packages are listed in *selected-packages.el*. Use `package-install-selected-packages' to install them all at once.

* To-do
+ Add better helm setup.
+ Add better Ecb faces.
+ Add langtool configuration.
+ Add some useful macros.
+ Add better windows management.
