* Introduction
It's just my Emacs configuration. Everything is tested with both Emacs 25.2 and the latest master branch. If you intend to use it, you will have to install those packages by yourself. Packages are listed in the *init.el* /package-selected-packages/ like everybody does. Following are a brief description of this repo.

* Features
** Many pre-configured stuffs
 Please check the files in *global-settings*.

** Some scripts
I am not a lisp programmer, yet. But writing some little script is still possible.
 + =trivial-ansi-mode= is a minor mode for displaying 24 bit ANSI true colors.

 + Minor scripts.
   Few minor scripts can make life easier. Have a look in *misc-trivialfis.el*
   - trivialfis/goto-pos
   - trivialfis/pop-frame
   - trivialfis/close-frame

** Excellent C/C++ IDE.
There are many packages configurated for C/C++ development. Mainly the following:
 + =Irony= for code completion.
 + =Flycheck= for error checking.
 + =Disaster= for viewing Assembly code.
 + =Semantic= for tagging.
   Although there are some other options out there like =gtags= and =rtags=. But they don't provide the same level of functionalities like =semantic= does.
 + =clang-format= for occasionally formatting.
 + =srefactor= for code refactor.

And I wrote a little script to configure libraries for these packages using Unix *pkg-config*.

** Other languages
Not really, I have some basic configuration for =python= and =elisp=. For other languages, I only need proper highlight to view them. You can add whatever you want to *langs* directory.

** Fast loading speed.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
time emacs -e "kill-emacs"

real	0m0.731s
user	0m0.537s
sys	        0m0.067s
#+END_SRC
Pretty good, right?

** Theme
I modified the atom-dark theme a little bit. The file =atom-dark-theme-c.el= in =.emacs.d= is the modified version. Change it back to =atom-dark-theme= then Emacs will load it correctly.

** Key bindings
There are so so many key bindings, most of them are set by individual package or by Emacs itself, here is a list of customized key bindings in global key map, you can find the list in *init.el*
